## this example decides whether a email is spam


## spam mail is a probability problem, a mail can not be 100% decided as spam, so I think
## clear_and_convincing is more reasonable


Default proof standard: clear_and_convincing


Main query: spam


## proof standard here

Proof standard: spam : beyond_reasonable_doubt


## some assumptions

Assumption: email in junk_email_category
Assumption: email has unsubscribe_choice
Assumption: not_cared information
Assumption: not browse shopping_website
Assumption: not click subscription
Assumption: not email goods food
Assumption: not email goods electronic_device
Assumption: email contains useful_information
Assumption: email has price
Assumption: email has selling_information


## some arguments

arg1: If email contains advertisement and not_need advertisement and email in junk_email_category then spam: 0.8

arg2: If not subscribed email and not_care goods then not_need goods: 0.8

arg3: If not browse shopping_website and not click subscription then not subscribed email: 0.8

arg4: If email has selling_information and email has price then email contains advertisement: 0.7

arg: If email promote sales and email has price then email has selling_information: 0.8

arg5: If not_need goods and not_cared information then not_need advertisement: 0.9

arg6: If email has unsubscribe_choice then user unsubscribe email: 0.9

## too less evidence to prove the result
arg7: If email contains useful_information then not spam: 0.19

arg8: If not email goods food and not email goods electronic_device then not_care goods: 0.9

## too less evidence to prove the result, besides a email has selling_information
##  although it can unsubscribe, but we can not decide it's not spam
arg9: If user unsubscribe email and email has selling_information then not spam: 0.19
