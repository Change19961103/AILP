## This example argues that whether Tony will eat outside or not


## some choices has a percentage problem, like the weather forecast, people will not totally trust one side, so I think
## clear_and_convincing is more reasonable

Default proof standard: clear_and_convincing


Main query: Tony eat outside


## proof standard here

Proof standard: Tony eat outside: beyond_reasonable_doubt


## some assumptions

Assumption: weather_forecast said "maybe rain today"
Assumption: TV weather_forecast
Assumption: weather_app showed "eighty_percent no_rain today "
Assumption: nearby restaurant
Assumption: Tony buy electrical_device
Assumption: Tony save_money everyday
Assumption: Tony do_homework at_school
Assumption: not Tony waste time_on_wayback
Assumption: Tony has good_grade


## some argument

arg1: If not rain today and has_enough_time Tony and parents agrees eat_outside and has_enough_money Tony then Tony eat outside: 0.95

## Maybe is a ambiguous word, can not trust it a lot
arg2: If weather_forecast said "maybe rain today" and TV weather_forecast then rain today: 0.3

## It gives a exact rate, thus people will trust it more
arg3: If weather_app showed "eighty_percent no_rain today " then not rain today: 0.8

arg4: If parents transfer money and Tony save_money everyday then has_enough_money Tony: 0.8

arg5: If Tony buy electrical_device and Tony save_money everyday then not has_enough_money Tony: 0.3

arg6: If Tony has good_grade then parents agrees eat_outside : 0.8

arg7: If Tony has good_grade then parents transfer money: 0.9

arg8: If Tony do_homework at_school and Tony study at_home then Tony has good_grade: 0.9

arg9: If nearby restaurant and Tony has no_much_homework then has_enough_time Tony unless Tony waste time_on_wayback: 0.7

arg10: If Tony do_homework at_school then Tony has no_much_homework: 0.8
